Changes for Harmony 2.0
-----------------------

I have replaced all reference instances of Harmony with HarmonyLib and changed the target framework to .NET 4.8 as
per the ONI Harmony 2.0 changelog. I have also updated mod_info.yaml to reflect the changes with Harmony 2.0. They are
as follows:

Updated the minimum supported build number to a recent build (required).
Added a mod version number (not necessary but useful).
Added Harmony's API version (required).
